    description: `Down in the pit or behind the decks, Cocktail Twinks is a powerful force in the local queer underworld. Already part of Pixelflowers, a live visuals duo who blends software, analog video synthesis, cameras and old digital hardware to enhance 'ecstatic rituals on sweaty dancefloors and dirty couches', since three years now they run HIGH, a sex positive party where live visuals and performances meets information and care.

With them we talked about conscious dancefloors, altered states and the artistic creativity as an escape from depression and alienation. Listen to their mix and read the full Interview on our IG.

          "Three years in the game now, and HIGH seems more alive than ever. Dark, genderfuck,techno ritual, but also sex positivity, awareness, community. Alongside a few other vital collectives in town, HIGH is part of a network that’s shaping a new sensibility within the party landscape, often in opposition to mainstream club culture. What’s the core concept behind your project, and how did it come to life?",

          "I started thinking of HIGH in 2022 with the intention of creating exactly the kind of party I wanted, bringing together the elements I had liked at other parties where I felt very comfortable but not completely satisfied. After having enjoyed some situations that opened my mind to what was possible – for example in the snake pit of GEGEN, that for some years had hosted very experimental acts thanks to the curation of the visionary industrial techno musician A/Ona, or at the queer industrial techno party Discipline, at the queer underground party Interzone and the kinky queer party Boar, which only lasted for a couple of years – I saw how Berlin’s gentrification was making experimentations and radical experiences rarer and rarer and how the most popular queer techno parties were turning commercial and aiming at filling dance floors with consumers rather than at opening up our minds to new perceptions of the world, art and existence. Even in this context, I could still find parties where I felt comfortable for different reasons. On the one hand, there were queer parties where I really liked the crowd and awareness, but where I didn't feel very in tune with the music, and on the other hand, there were parties focused on the music genres I like most, where I could get carried away by the dance, but where the dance floor was full of people who weren't on my wavelength, even at parties that tried to give space to FLINTA DJs and artists. And then there were events more focused on a kinky community where the music I like would have fit in perfectly, but there was no investment on musical research and booking. So the idea was to bring together a radical queer crowd, darker music genres like industrial techno and EBM, and an atmosphere focused on BDSM practices. Alongside these desires, there was of course also a criticism of commercial parties in the post-pandemic gentrification of Berlin. It was clear to me that both the queer and the techno scenes were being appropriated to produce a profitable entertainment industry, which for me was the opposite of why I go to a party, namely not simply to have fun, go back home and start the routine all over again, but to find an artistic proposal within a safer space that opens minds and leads to the creation of a community of shared joy. For me it’s important to remember that techno flourished in grassroots experiences, leading to moments of radical criticism with the temporary autonomous zones of raves, and that before that happened it had been born from the black, and queer, communities of post-industrial cities in the United States. So for me a successful party is a political party, not an event geared towards enriching promoters or glorifying DJs, and that’s what I had in mind when I started thinking of HIGH.",

          "Another key element in parties like HIGH is the pursuit of a freer, though conscious, sense of individual expression within a safe space. That freedom extends to sexuality as much as to open consumption. In your opinion, what role does the altered state play within the sex positive techno scene? Can free consumption foster a more genuine, even safer, form of participation?",

        message:
          "To begin with, I don't believe that altered states of consciousness are produced solely through drug consumption. Altered states of consciousness can be achieved through many different techniques. The achievement of altered states of consciousness as an initiation, if you will, into a path of existential awareness is a very ancient practice. For me, a successful party leads to a path of this kind, a path that goes through an altered state of consciousness and is aimed at exorcising death and at living life in a more fulfilling way. And this path can be achieved through the use of psychedelic substances, but also through other practices such as sleep deprivation, fasting, reaching subspace in a BDSM session or even simply dancing for hours in a circle in a trance-inducing repetition of movements. Many traditional rituals predominantly use dance as a means of achieving an altered state of consciousness (and I should mention here that I was taking part in traditional Southern Italian dance rites before I was attracted to techno). In the pharmaco-pornographic era (to quote Paul Preciado), the achievement of such states is not restricted to few individuals which the people consider gifted with shamanic powers – now the “magic initiation” can be consciously hacked into to build moments of shared joy and pleasure that can be turned into the foundations of communities driven by awareness, solidarity and compassion. So I think that the achievement of altered states of consciousness is not so much about individual expression as about a collective journey in which everyone aims to reach a certain state together, the ego is suspended and the sense of existence as individuals is left behind in order to achieve a sense of shared liberation. In this sense, I would say that in the context of parties like HIGH sexual expression can lead to altered states of consciousness as much as substance use can pave the way to sexual liberation. These are only some of the elements of a wider formula – a formula whose purpose is the construction of a collective ritual rather than individual liberation. Of course, individual liberation is ultimately achieved as well, but only because there’s a community supporting the individual. So we are talking about a ritual that allows us to share collective joy and experiences, bringing about mutual empowerment and a change in our reality – a change in which everyone is freer to be themselves and everyone supports each other in overcoming dogmas and fixed rules. So if we approach the ritual with awareness – if we know why we consume, why we enter a dark room, why we engage in a BDSM session, if we know why we dance, what’s the purpose of this all – we can achieve a more genuine and safer form of participation, precisely because the goal is participation, not consumption.",

          "Part of your artistic roots lie in the so-called Roma Est scene. Thinking of places like Fanfulla or Dal Verme, the latter forced to close in 2016 along with many other independent venues, following the enforcement of a Public Security Act dating back to 1931, during the Fascist era. Then as now, in Rome as in Berlin, independent spaces often remain the only possibility for collectives like HIGH to operate with real autonomy. To what extent can independent culture coexist with the mainstream? And how can its survival be safeguarded in a city increasingly shaped by market logic?",

        talker: "C.T",
        message:
          "It’s true – today I’m certainly connected to Roma Est, and it all started with a strong fascination towards Forte Prenestino, a historical squat in a 19th century fortress in the middle of Rome East. And I find it interesting that you mention this area of Rome as the origin of my “artistic” roots, as that part of Rome is currently one of the few places of resistance to the neo-fascist drift that has engulfed Italy in the 2010s and 2020s. The truth is, though, that my artistic, and political, roots date back to long before my contacts with Roma Est, and are primarily linked to the squatting and self-management experiences of the 1990s and 2000s and to the awareness of what these experiences made possible in terms of creativity, sociality and direct action all over Italy in those years. It was through those experiences that I was introduced to the ideas of temporary autonomous zones, DIY, hacking, feminism, anti-prohibitionism and anti-psychiatry, just to name a few. And I got in touch with these ideas first through social centres in Naples, Bologna and Northern Italy and only after that in Rome. And I can see how certain successful parties in Berlin were created by people who came from these experiences (in Italy and other countries) and owe much of their existence to these realities of occupation and radical politics. The first person that comes to mind is Francesco Macarone Palmieri, aka Cichitone, aka DJ Warbear, one of the founders of GEGEN who, before moving to Berlin, had organised queer parties at Forte Prenestino, and who in the 2000s was the co-editor of Torazine, an amazing underground fanzine linked to raves, anti-prohibitionism and radical queer politics. And I can see how the success of certain parties in Berlin in the 2000s and 2010s was due to the skills that were developed by creating sociality and underground culture in social centres and TAZs. Without these experiences, some of the most popular parties in Berlin at the moment would probably not have existed or would have had a completely different history and vibe. So now that those autonomous spaces are shrinking both in Italy and in Berlin, and everything is becoming more regulated and profit-oriented, I can see how the artistic scope of techno parties is shrinking as well. Nowadays, many DJs and musicians are not booked for the music they play but for how much they make people dance and consume, for how many people they attract, how many followers they have on Instagram, whether they are influencers or not. Thus I believe that without self-management and with capitalism as the main driving force, we are losing a lot of genuine creativity and radical artistic scope, if we consider true art as a critique of reality and the existing order. So now we need to find spaces that allow us to keep creating in an independent and radical manner – spaces that make self-management still possible – by renting small venues for example, by reducing the scale of our events, by recognising that only by aiming at reaching smaller groups of people can we create moments of true creativity.",

          "Playing music as Cocktail Twinks, promoting consciousness (and unconsciousness!) through HIGH, or tripping out dancefloors alongside Pixi in your visual project Pixelflowers, you seem to invest a deep sense of self in everything you create, a reflection of your genuine connection to your community. In this sense, how much of your identity is shaped by what you do? And to what extent the environment we inhabit and the culture we belong to influence the existence of those who live art at such a deep level?",

          "I must say that I don’t find it particularly easy to define the word identity and to describe what my own identity is about in the first place! However, I can say that only when I connected with a radical queer community did I begin to feel welcome and free to publicly express both my nonbinary identity and my artistic creativity. Previously, in the absence of a radical queer community, this had been very hard for me, to the point of reaching a state of strong alienation and never feeling completely comfortable with the people around me, no matter how close they were as friends and no matter how many initiatives I organised with them. It was only when I arrived in Berlin and participated in the rituals that I now create, through music, VJing and organising queer parties, that I was able to feel empowered and make profound choices for my entire life. So the environment I inhabit and the culture I belong to totally influence my existence and my creativity. Without the creativity I have been able to experience in this context, and without the altered states of consciousness that have opened up to me thanks to the rituals of Berlin's techno and queer scenes, none of what I am experiencing would be possible, and probably not being able to imagine a future of joy would have led me to a state of depression and alienation that I now see afflicting a large part of the population of the advanced capitalistic world in the grip of rampant authoritarianism. To quote another important source of my reflections on all this – Raving by McKenzie Wark, “I wish Mark [Fisher] had joined us”.",

A couple of years later I started running clandestine parties in abandoned spaces like a burnt-out house, a former car wash, an old slaughterhouse. On the main floor I would play mostly NDW, while in other rooms you could stumble upon installations like an entire Faust or Monte Cazazza record played all night from an old cassette player. At the same time, I was also playing in bands inspired by the Düsseldorfer Schule, among others. I immersed myself so deeply in all this that when I eventually moved to Berlin, it felt like a déjà vu or as if I had already been here before.

We welcome interpretations that diverge from our original intent — even more so when the result leaves a lasting impact. Guy Tavares, along with the events and music of Bunker Records, played an important role in shaping the label. At the time, I was still in Ukraine, but a group of like-minded people who became my friends later regularly traveled to The Hague from Berlin. Bunker succeeded in creating a deeply engaging community where music took on new colors. They offered strong support when we came up with the idea of spreading this “virus”; Guy even gave us permission to use the name of legendary squat in den Haague where he used to organize events.

In the 70s–90s, each underground movement — from British industrial to Siberian punk — brought something radically new, influencing the entire music industry, even commerce. Many of those artists became famous only years later, as their goal was to oppose mainstream culture.Today, there are countless releases in the genres of noise, industrial, noise rock, or any experimental genre that are referred to as “underground,” but many of them simply repeat what successful artists were doing decades ago(And I am by no means saying that artists do not do anything interesting or contribute anything of their own; I am talking about more global issues.). Unique works do exist, but they are the exception. Some projects have achieved recognition and pushed boundaries, but they are rare. To me, saying “the underground has been sold” is as wrong as saying “the underground is alive and thriving” and both are partly true. The underground of 30 years ago is gone, replaced by a scene with endless ways to share and discover music. Something new appears daily, yet it rarely changes our understanding of art. My criticism is aimed at those clinging to absolutes: the underground is alive, but it’s far from what it once was.",
